# Recipe Book Website 🍲📖

## About the Project 🚀

The Recipe Book Website is a dynamic web application built with **React.js** that allows users to explore, search, and view detailed recipes. It is designed with **responsive** features, ensuring optimal viewing experiences on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktops. This project showcases my skills in React.js, component-based architecture, and making an interactive and intuitive frontend experience. The website fetches both local and API-based recipe data, displays them in a clean and visually appealing layout, and enables users to explore each recipe's details through a detailed page view.

## Technical Skills & Features 💻🛠️

### Frontend Technologies 🌐
- **React.js**: Core framework for building the application, allowing for a modular and scalable structure.
- **React Router**: Used for navigation between different pages like home, category, and recipe details.
- **CSS Flexbox & Grid**: Layout and styling techniques for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface. 
- **SASS (CSS Preprocessing)**: For cleaner, more maintainable styling with variables, mixins, and reusable code.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the website is mobile-friendly and adapts perfectly to various screen sizes, from phones to desktops.
- **React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)**: For managing state and side effects within functional components.

### Backend and APIs 🌍
- **Spoonacular API**: The heart of our recipe database! The Spoonacular API serves as the gateway to thousands of delicious recipes, each with detailed information such as ingredients, cooking instructions, and prep time. This API enables the website to pull fresh and varied content from an external source, ensuring users have access to an extensive collection of recipes. By querying this API with search filters like recipe name or ingredient, users can discover new dishes with ease.
  
- **Local JSON Data**: Local JSON data serves as a special touch in this project, providing **custom recipes** tailored to specific needs. While the Spoonacular API offers thousands of options, the local JSON data allows for the inclusion of personal, unique, or even seasonal recipes. It can be a fallback if the API is slow or unresponsive, or even to showcase specific categories (like "local favorites") directly from a static source. This ensures that the app remains functional and rich with content even in the absence of external calls.

### Key Features ✨
- **Search Bar 🔍**: A search feature that allows users to find recipes by ingredients or title.
- **Recipe Cards 📋**: Displays a list of featured/popular recipes with an image, title, and a short description.
- **Recipe Detail Page 📜**: Clicking on any recipe will navigate to a detailed page that shows the full recipe, including detailed instructions, ingredients, and cooking time.
- **Interactive UI**: Clean design with hover effects and animations to make the app feel interactive and engaging.

## Challenges Overcome 🚧
- **Handling API Calls**: Managing data fetching with asynchronous calls and displaying the data in a seamless manner.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Ensuring the design adapts perfectly to various devices, providing an optimal user experience on mobile and desktop screens.
- **UI/UX Design**: Creating a clean, simple, and intuitive user interface, focusing on ease of use and aesthetic appeal.
